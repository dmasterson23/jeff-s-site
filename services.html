              I cannot say enough good things about Jeff and his work. He has DJ'd my sweet 16, my graduation party, my proms and homecomings for school as well my wedding yesterday. You can count on him to have the best time at your events and you can tell he loves every second of his job and he makes everyone feel that when he plays that music. Jeff, you're the best there is, I wouldn't ever recommend any other DJ but you. Fantastic job and I will definitely be using you time after time in the future.

              My husband and I booked Master Sounds Entertainment to DJ our wedding and I could not recommend them enough. Jeff is experienced and professional. He was the most helpful of all of our vendors and he went above and beyond to make sure our big day went as smoothly as possible. 
              His suggestions for music/games were an absolute hit and our guests are still talking about what a great time they had. Jeff even jumped in on the dance floor to teach us some dance moves!! I am so thankful we found someone so great to DJ our wedding.
